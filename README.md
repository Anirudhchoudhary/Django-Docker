## Introduction

This repository aims to simplify the process of setting up a Django development environment using Docker containers. Docker allows us to encapsulate our application and its dependencies within isolated containers, providing consistency across various environments and easing the setup process.

## Features

- Dockerized Django development environment.
- Ready-to-use Mysql:8 database container.
- Easy-to-extend Docker Compose configuration for other services (Redis, Celery, etc.).
- Development and Production configurations for Django settings.
- Simplified management commands using Docker Compose.

## Requirements

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Docker: [https://www.docker.com/get-docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your Django development environment:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-docker-repo.git
cd django-docker-repo
Create a new file named .env in the root directory (you can use .env.example as a template) and provide the required environment variables.

Build the Docker images:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose build
Set up the Django project and apply migrations:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate
Create a superuser (optional):
bash
Copy code
docker-compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser
Usage
To start the development server, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
The Django development server should now be running at http://localhost:8000/.

To execute other Django management commands, use the following syntax:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose run web python manage.py <command>
For example, to create a new app:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose run web python manage.py startapp myapp
To stop the containers, press Ctrl+C.
